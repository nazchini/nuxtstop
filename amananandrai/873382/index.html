  Algorithms
</h2>

<p>Machine Learning is an integral part of Data Science and most of us are fascinated by the type of things it is doing in our day-to-day life like Self driven cars, Robots and AI assistants talking in almost human language, detection of diseases like cancer, facial recognition, etc. All these things are only possible because of data and the ML algorithms which work on this data. ML algorithms which are most widely used by Data scientists is listed below. It includes a wide variety of algorithms from most basic algorithms like regression and decision trees to high profile Deep Learning algorithms like Transformers, GANs and RNNs.</p>

<ul>
<li><p><strong>Linear and Logistic Regression</strong> - These are the most basic algorithms of the ML ecosystem. Almost every data scientist learns these two algorithms as their first ML algorithm. Linear regression algorithm is basically a curve fitting algorithm which is used to determine trends and predict the value of dependent variable from independent variables. Logistic regression is used for classification tasks and finds probability of class.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Decision Trees or Random Forests</strong> - Decision Trees are another popular ML algorithm where based on certain decisions the possible consequences are defined. It can be used for both classification and regression task. It is an ensemble technique that combines many different decision trees to give the output.  For classification tasks, the output of the random forest is the class selected by most trees. For regression tasks, the mean or average prediction of the individual trees is returned.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Gradient Boosting Machines</strong> - Gradient boosting is a machine learning technique used in regression and classification tasks, among others. It gives a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, which are typically decision trees.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Convolutional Neural Networks</strong> - A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a class of artificial neural network, most commonly applied to analyze visual imagery.  They have applications in image and video recognition, recommender systems, image classification, image segmentation, medical image analysis, natural language processing, brain-computer interfaces, and financial time series. CNNs are regularized versions of multilayer perceptrons.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Bayesian Approaches</strong> - Bayesian inference is a method of statistical inference in which Bayes' theorem is used to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.  </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Dense Neural Networks</strong> - It is another class of neural networks that is connected deeply, which means each neuron in the dense layer receives input from all neurons of its previous layer. The dense layer is found to be the most commonly used layer in the models.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Recurrent Neural Networks</strong> - Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) are a type of Neural Network where the output from previous step are fed as input to the current step. It is the first algorithm that remembers its input, due to an internal memory, which makes it perfectly suited for machine learning problems that involve sequential data. The different variants of RNN architecture are Bidirectional recurrent neural networks (BRNN), Long short-term memory (LSTM), and Gated recurrent units (GRUs). </p></li>
<li><p><strong>Transformer Networks</strong> - A transformer is a deep learning model that adopts the mechanism of attention, differentially weighting the significance of each part of the input data. It is used primarily in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and in computer vision (CV). Like recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers are designed to handle sequential input data, such as natural language, for tasks such as translation and text summarization. Some famous Transformer architectures are BERT and GPT.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Generative Adversarial Network</strong> - Generative Adversarial Networks, or GANs for short, are an approach to generative modeling using deep learning methods, such as convolutional neural networks. Generative modeling is an unsupervised learning task in machine learning that involves automatically discovering and learning the regularities or patterns in input data in such a way that the model can be used to generate or output new examples that plausibly could have been drawn from the original dataset. The GAN model architecture involves two sub-models: a generator model for generating new examples and a discriminator model for classifying whether generated examples are real, from the domain, or fake, generated by the generator model.</p></li>
<li><p><strong>Evolutionary Approaches</strong> - Evolutionary algorithms are a heuristic-based approach to solving problems that cannot be easily solved in polynomial time, such as classically NP-Hard problems, and anything else that would take far too long to exhaustively process. Genetic Algorithm is the most common evolutionary algorithm. It is used in Optimization of the neural networks and ML models.</p></li>

  Automated Machine Learning Frameworks
</h2>

<p>Automated machine learning (AutoML) is the process of applying machine learning (ML) models to real-world problems using automation. More specifically, it automates the selection, composition and parameterization of machine learning models. These frameworks help in implementing AutoML. The different steps in traditional ML are data pre-processing, feature engineering, feature extraction, feature selection, algorithm selection, and hyperparameter optimization. AutoML helps automate this entire pipeline. AutoML dramatically simplifies these steps for non-experts. </p>

Spyder integrates with a number of prominent packages in the scientific Python stack, including NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, pandas, IPython, SymPy and Cython, as well as other open-source software.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Notepad++</strong> - Notepad++ is a text and source code editor for use with Microsoft Windows. It supports tabbed editing, which allows working with multiple open files in a single window.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Sublime text</strong> - Sublime Text is a commercial source code editor. It natively supports many programming languages and markup languages. Users can expand its functionality with plugins, typically community-built and maintained under free-software licenses. To facilitate plugins, Sublime Text features a Python API.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Vim or Emacs</strong> - Vim is a free and open-source, screen-based text editor program for Unix. Emacs  or EMACS (Editor MACroS) is a family of text editors that are characterized by their extensibility. The manual for the most widely used variant, <em>GNU Emacs</em>, describes it as "the extensible, customizable, self-documenting, real-time display editor". These two are used in the UNIX and LINUX based systems and are one of the oldest text editors.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>MATLAB</strong> - MATLAB is a proprietary multi-paradigm programming language and numeric computing environment developed by MathWorks. MATLAB allows matrix manipulations, plotting of functions and data, implementation of algorithms, creation of user interfaces, and interfacing with programs written in other languages.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name="algorithms" href="#algorithms">\n  </a>\n  Algorithms\n</h2>\n\n<p>Machine Learning is an integral part of Data Science and most of us are fascinated by the type of things it is doing in our day-to-day life like Self driven cars, Robots and AI assistants talking in almost human language, detection of diseases like cancer, facial recognition, etc. All these things are only possible because of data and the ML algorithms which work on this data. ML algorithms which are most widely used by Data scientists is listed below. It includes a wide variety of algorithms from most basic algorithms like regression and decision trees to high profile Deep Learning algorithms like Transformers, GANs and RNNs.</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p><strong>Linear and Logistic Regression</strong> - These are the most basic algorithms of the ML ecosystem. Almost every data scientist learns these two algorithms as their first ML algorithm. Linear regression algorithm is basically a curve fitting algorithm which is used to determine trends and predict the value of dependent variable from independent variables. Logistic regression is used for classification tasks and finds probability of class.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Decision Trees or Random Forests</strong> - Decision Trees are another popular ML algorithm where based on certain decisions the possible consequences are defined. It can be used for both classification and regression task. It is an ensemble technique that combines many different decision trees to give the output.  For classification tasks, the output of the random forest is the class selected by most trees. For regression tasks, the mean or average prediction of the individual trees is returned.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Gradient Boosting Machines</strong> - Gradient boosting is a machine learning technique used in regression and classification tasks, among others. It gives a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, which are typically decision trees.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Convolutional Neural Networks</strong> - A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a class of artificial neural network, most commonly applied to analyze visual imagery.  They have applications in image and video recognition, recommender systems, image classification, image segmentation, medical image analysis, natural language processing, brain-computer interfaces, and financial time series. CNNs are regularized versions of multilayer perceptrons.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Bayesian Approaches</strong> - Bayesian inference is a method of statistical inference in which Bayes\' theorem is used to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.  </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Dense Neural Networks</strong> - It is another class of neural networks that is connected deeply, which means each neuron in the dense layer receives input from all neurons of its previous layer. The dense layer is found to be the most commonly used layer in the models.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Recurrent Neural Networks</strong> - Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) are a type of Neural Network where the output from previous step are fed as input to the current step. It is the first algorithm that remembers its input, due to an internal memory, which makes it perfectly suited for machine learning problems that involve sequential data. The different variants of RNN architecture are Bidirectional recurrent neural networks (BRNN), Long short-term memory (LSTM), and Gated recurrent units (GRUs). </p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Transformer Networks</strong> - A transformer is a deep learning model that adopts the mechanism of attention, differentially weighting the significance of each part of the input data. It is used primarily in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and in computer vision (CV). Like recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers are designed to handle sequential input data, such as natural language, for tasks such as translation and text summarization. Some famous Transformer architectures are BERT and GPT.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Generative Adversarial Network</strong> - Generative Adversarial Networks, or GANs for short, are an approach to generative modeling using deep learning methods, such as convolutional neural networks. Generative modeling is an unsupervised learning task in machine learning that involves automatically discovering and learning the regularities or patterns in input data in such a way that the model can be used to generate or output new examples that plausibly could have been drawn from the original dataset. The GAN model architecture involves two sub-models: a generator model for generating new examples and a discriminator model for classifying whether generated examples are real, from the domain, or fake, generated by the generator model.</p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Evolutionary Approaches</strong> - Evolutionary algorithms are a heuristic-based approach to solving problems that cannot be easily solved in polynomial time, such as classically NP-Hard problems, and anything else that would take far too long to exhaustively process. Genetic Algorithm is the most common evolutionary algorithm. It is used in Optimization of the neural networks and ML models.</p></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name="machine-learning-frameworks" href="#machine-learning-frameworks">\n  </a>\n  Machine Learning Frameworks\n</h2>\n\n<p>There are many frameworks built in many languages but mostly Python which have the code for implementing the various ML algorithms discussed above. These frameworks make the life of Data scientists quite easier as they have to just call a simple Python function to implement the most complex of ML algorithms without getting into the nitty-gritty of them.

I am using the term Data Professionals to refer to all different jobs associated with data like Data Scientists, Data Analysts, Data Engineers. To become a better Data Professional we need to have knowledge of different domains but the most important skill set required are knowledge of Databases and SQL, languages like Python, R, Julia, JavaScript, etc.,  experience in Data Visualization tools like Tableau and PowerBI,  and knowledge of Bigdata and Cloud Technologies.\n\nIn this post, I am going to give a list of different tools and technologies which have been used extensively by Data Professionals throughout the year and the expertise of these can make you one of the best in the industry. This list is based on a survey conducted by Kaggle (the biggest community of Data Scientists). I have used the term toolset because it is a comprehensive list of tools from different domains. \n\n## IDE\n\nThe most common languages used for Data Science are Python, R, JavaScript, MATLAB, Julia along with SQL. These languages are used for data analysis and visualization, building machine learning algorithms, implementing data pipelines, and various other things related to Data science. The most important tool we require are IDEs (Integrated Development Environments) where we write code, compile them and then execute them to view the output. Here is a list of most common IDEs used by different Data professionals for development which makes their life easier. \n  \n* __Jupyter Notebook__ - Jupyter Notebook is a web-based interactive computational environment for creating Jupyter notebook documents. It supports several languages like Python (IPython), Julia, R etc. and is largely used for data analysis, data visualization and further interactive, exploratory computing.\n\n* __Visual Studio Code__ - Visual Studio Code (VS Code) is a source-code editor made by Microsoft for Windows, Linux and macOS. Features include support for debugging, syntax highlighting, intelligent code completion, snippets, code refactoring, and embedded Git. It can be used for writing code in many languages and is one of the most popular IDE among Software engineers as well for its wide variety of features.\n \n* __Jupyter Lab__ - JupyterLab is the next-generation user interface including notebooks. It has a modular structure, where you can open several notebooks or files (e.g. HTML, Text, Markdowns etc) as tabs in the same window. It offers more of an IDE-like experience.\n\n* __PyCharm__ - PyCharm is an IDE used specifically for the Python language. It is developed by the Czech company JetBrains. It provides code analysis, a graphical debugger, an integrated unit tester, integration with version control systems, and supports web development with Django as well as data science with Anaconda. PyCharm is cross-platform, with Windows, macOS and Linux versions.\n \n* __R Studio__ - RStudio is an IDE for R, a programming language for statistical computing, data science, and data visualization. It is available in two formats: RStudio Desktop is a regular desktop application while RStudio Server runs on a remote server and allows accessing RStudio using a web browser.\n\n* __Spyder__ - Spyder is an open-source cross-platform IDE for scientific programming in the Python language. Spyder integrates with a number of prominent packages in the scientific Python stack, including NumPy, SciPy, Matplotlib, pandas, IPython, SymPy and Cython, as well as other open-source software.\n\n* __Notepad++__ - Notepad++ is a text and source code editor for use with Microsoft Windows. It supports tabbed editing, which allows working with multiple open files in a single window.\n\n* __Sublime text__ - Sublime Text is a commercial source code editor. It natively supports many programming languages and markup languages. Users can expand its functionality with plugins, typically community-built and maintained under free-software licenses. To facilitate plugins, Sublime Text features a Python API.\n\n* __Vim or Emacs__ - Vim is a free and open-source, screen-based text editor program for Unix. Emacs  or EMACS (Editor MACroS) is a family of text editors that are characterized by their extensibility. The manual for the most widely used variant, _GNU Emacs_, describes it as \"the extensible, customizable, self-documenting, real-time display editor\". These two are used in the UNIX and LINUX based systems and are one of the oldest text editors.\n\n* __MATLAB__ - MATLAB is a proprietary multi-paradigm programming language and numeric computing environment developed by MathWorks. MATLAB allows matrix manipulations, plotting of functions and data, implementation of algorithms, creation of user interfaces, and interfacing with programs written in other languages.\n\n## Algorithms\n\nMachine Learning is an integral part of Data Science and most of us are fascinated by the type of things it is doing in our day-to-day life like Self driven cars, Robots and AI assistants talking in almost human language, detection of diseases like cancer, facial recognition, etc. All these things are only possible because of data and the ML algorithms which work on this data. ML algorithms which are most widely used by Data scientists is listed below. It includes a wide variety of algorithms from most basic algorithms like regression and decision trees to high profile Deep Learning algorithms like Transformers, GANs and RNNs.\n \n* __Linear and Logistic Regression__ - These are the most basic algorithms of the ML ecosystem. Almost every data scientist learns these two algorithms as their first ML algorithm. Linear regression algorithm is basically a curve fitting algorithm which is used to determine trends and predict the value of dependent variable from independent variables. Logistic regression is used for classification tasks and finds probability of class.\n\n* __Decision Trees or Random Forests__ - Decision Trees are another popular ML algorithm where based on certain decisions the possible consequences are defined. It can be used for both classification and regression task. It is an ensemble technique that combines many different decision trees to give the output.  For classification tasks, the output of the random forest is the class selected by most trees. For regression tasks, the mean or average prediction of the individual trees is returned.\n\n* __Gradient Boosting Machines__ - Gradient boosting is a machine learning technique used in regression and classification tasks, among others. It gives a prediction model in the form of an ensemble of weak prediction models, which are typically decision trees.\n\n* __Convolutional Neural Networks__ - A convolutional neural network (CNN) is a class of artificial neural network, most commonly applied to analyze visual imagery.  They have applications in image and video recognition, recommender systems, image classification, image segmentation, medical image analysis, natural language processing, brain-computer interfaces, and financial time series. CNNs are regularized versions of multilayer perceptrons.\n\n* __Bayesian Approaches__ - Bayesian inference is a method of statistical inference in which Bayes' theorem is used to update the probability for a hypothesis as more evidence or information becomes available.  \n\n* __Dense Neural Networks__ - It is another class of neural networks that is connected deeply, which means each neuron in the dense layer receives input from all neurons of its previous layer. The dense layer is found to be the most commonly used layer in the models.\n\n* __Recurrent Neural Networks__ - Recurrent Neural Network(RNN) are a type of Neural Network where the output from previous step are fed as input to the current step. It is the first algorithm that remembers its input, due to an internal memory, which makes it perfectly suited for machine learning problems that involve sequential data. The different variants of RNN architecture are Bidirectional recurrent neural networks (BRNN), Long short-term memory (LSTM), and Gated recurrent units (GRUs). \n\n* __Transformer Networks__ - A transformer is a deep learning model that adopts the mechanism of attention, differentially weighting the significance of each part of the input data. It is used primarily in the field of natural language processing (NLP) and in computer vision (CV). Like recurrent neural networks (RNNs), transformers are designed to handle sequential input data, such as natural language, for tasks such as translation and text summarization. Some famous Transformer architectures are BERT and GPT.\n\n* __Generative Adversarial Network__ - Generative Adversarial Networks, or GANs for short, are an approach to generative modeling using deep learning methods, such as convolutional neural networks. Generative modeling is an unsupervised learning task in machine learning that involves automatically discovering and learning the regularities or patterns in input data in such a way that the model can be used to generate or output new examples that plausibly could have been drawn from the original dataset. The GAN model architecture involves two sub-models: a generator model for generating new examples and a discriminator model for classifying whether generated examples are real, from the domain, or fake, generated by the generator model.\n\n* __Evolutionary Approaches__ - Evolutionary algorithms are a heuristic-based approach to solving problems that cannot be easily solved in polynomial time, such as classically NP-Hard problems, and anything else that would take far too long to exhaustively process. Genetic Algorithm is the most common evolutionary algorithm. It is used in Optimization of the neural networks and ML models.\n\n## Machine Learning Frameworks\n\nThere are many frameworks built in many languages but mostly Python which have the code for implementing the various ML algorithms discussed above. These frameworks make the life of Data scientists quite easier as they have to just call a simple Python function to implement the most complex of ML algorithms without getting into the nitty-gritty of them. Some of the most prominent ML frameworks are listed below. \n\n* __Scikit-learn__ - It is one of the most widely used frameworks for Python based Data science tasks.

More specifically, it automates the selection, composition and parameterization of machine learning models. These frameworks help in implementing AutoML. The different steps in traditional ML are data pre-processing, feature engineering, feature extraction, feature selection, algorithm selection, and hyperparameter optimization. AutoML helps automate this entire pipeline. AutoML dramatically simplifies these steps for non-experts. \n\n* __Google Cloud AutoML__ - https://cloud.google.com/automl\n* __Azure Automated Machine Learning__ - https://azure.microsoft.com/en-in/services/machine-learning/automatedml/\n* __Amazon Sagemaker Autopilot__ - https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/autopilot/\n* __H2O Driverless AI__ - https://www.h2o.ai/products/h2o-driverless-ai/\n* __Databricks AutoML__ - https://databricks.com/product/automl\n* __DataRobot AutoML__ - https://www.datarobot.com/platform/automated-machine-learning/\n\n\n\n ",o.user={name:a,username:a,twitter_username:a,github_username:a,website_url:"https://amananandrai.github.io/",profile_image:"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--Xl1gVQZ9--/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,h_640,q_auto,w_640/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/profile_image/355422/d9bae3e1-e185-4e93-a850-58be1b042695.png",profile_image_90:"https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--6i6RMOO1--/c_fill,f_auto,fl_progressive,h_90,q_auto,w_90/https://dev-to-uploads.s3.amazonaws.com/uploads/user/profile_image/355422/d9bae3e1-e185-4e93-a850-58be1b042695.png"},{layout:"default",data:[{}],fetch:{"data-v-70afb46a:0":{article:o}},error:e,state:{currentArticle:o},serverRendered:!0,routePath:"/amananandrai/873382",config:{_app:{basePath:"/nuxtstop/",assetsPath:"/nuxtstop/_nuxt/",cdnURL:e}}}}(null,"amananandrai","2021-11-13T17:13:52Z",{},"https://dev.to/amananandrai/data-science-toolset-summary-from-2021-1dbi")</script><script src="/nuxtstop/_nuxt/f6e87fb.js" defer></script><script src="/nuxtstop/_nuxt/dc9ce94.js" defer></script><script src="/nuxtstop/_nuxt/6474719.js" defer></script><script src="/nuxtstop/_nuxt/9b75090.js" defer></script><script src="/nuxtstop/_nuxt/18df600.js" defer></script>
