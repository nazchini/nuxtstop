<p>Hello folks, If you are a computer science graduate or a programmer who wants to learn Java, or someone who wants to start programming with Java, and looking for some awesome resources like books, tutorials, and online courses then you have come to the right place. </p>

<p>Being a Java developer for last 15 years, and author of one of the popular Java blog, <a href="//javarevisited.blogspot.com/">Javarevisited</a> (yes, I have been writing Java article since 2010), I often receive requests for recommendation and learning resources.  </p>

<p>In the past, I have shared some great <a href="https://dev.to/javinpaul/11-best-java-books-for-beginners-and-senior-developers-4b5">books</a> and <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/01/top-10-java-9-tutorials-and-courses.html">tutorials</a> to learn Java and in this article, I am going to share some of the <strong>best Java courses beginners</strong> can join to learn Java.</p>

<p>One of the main problems with learning Java is to keep pace with the increasing number of releases. For example, <a href="http://www.java67.com/2014/09/top-10-java-8-tutorials-best-of-lot.html">Java 8</a> was released in 2014 which completely changed how Java is written and after that we have a new Java version in every six month. </p>

<p>Before you can start with <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/02/top-5-java-9-courses-to-learn-online.html#axzz5CdW6rG8R">Java 9</a> and <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/03/java-10-released-10-new-features-java.html#axzz5ALJyiIAt">Java 10</a>, you realize Java 17 is coming. But the good thing is that the core of Java is still the same and all its releases are backward compatible.</p>

<p>If you are learning Java first time, then it's very important to choose the online course which is up-to-date, otherwise, you will be left behind in the job market and your day-to-day programming job with outdated skills.</p>

<p>But, before that, let me first congratulate you on making an <strong>excellent decision of learning Java</strong>, one of the most popular main-stream programming language of the world.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/language/index.html">Java Programming language</a> is been around for more than 20+ years now and it has expanded its reach to almost every single field, from small mobile apps to large banking application running on major Investment banks.</p>

<p>Java is mainly used as a server-side language to create high performance, low latency servers to handle the complex task. Java is really big on <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2011/04/top-20-core-java-interview-questions.html">Investment banks</a> which uses it to write end-to-end trading applications like front office application for trade capture, middle office applications to handle booking and allocation and back-office application for sending confirmations.</p>

<p>Another area where Java really shines is for creating Android applications. Though Google has now declared <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/02/kotlin-vs-java-which-language-android.html">Kotlin</a> as the official language for <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2017/12/top-5-android-online-training-courses-for-Java-developers.html">Android app development</a>, Java is still quite big and there is no sign of any slowdown in coming years.</p>

  My Favorite Best and Free Online Courses to Learn Java for Beginners
</h2>

<p>In this article, I have curated some of the best Java online courses from popular online learning websites like <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Couresra</a>, <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a> and <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/">Pluarlsight</a>, which are both comprehensive and up-to-date but at the same time suitable for beginners. Btw, I also review courses and get paid if one of you buy the course from the link in this article.</p>

<p>Without any further ado, here are them:</p>

  1. The Complete Java Masterclass [Udemy]
</h3>

<p>This is probably the most popular <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&subid=0&offerid=323058.1&type=10&tmpid=14538&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fjava-the-complete-java-developer-course%2F">Java course</a> on Udemy with over 207,000 students enrolled in this course.</p>

<p>It has got more than 40K 4.6 ratings which speak a lot about its quality but the most important thing I like about this course that instructor has frequently updated it to include changes from <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2016/10/best-books-to-learn-java-8.html">Java 8</a> and <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/02/10-books-java-developers-should-read-in.html">Java 9</a>.</p>

<p>It's a comprehensive course with over 72 hours of material and you will learn all major things a Java developer should know like data structure, OOP, Core Java Fundamentals, Java Collections, <a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/8-best-multithreading-and-concurrency-courses-for-experienced-java-developers-8acfd3b25094">MultiThreading</a>, File IO, Networking, Database, Java 8, Unit Testing and recent Java changes.</p>

<p>The instructor <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=CuIbQrBnhiw&mid=39197&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fuser%2Ftimbuchalka%2F">Tim Buchalka</a> is also a famous Java instructor in Udemy and that shows with enormous social proof associated with this course. Every single concept is explained in detail and you will learn the concept one program at a time.</p>

<p>You will not only learn concepts but also tools which are free like <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/02/5-free-eclipse-and-junit-online-courses-java-developers.html">Eclipse</a>, <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/02/6-free-maven-and-jenkins-online-courses-for-java-developers.html">Maven</a>, etc and essential for Java development.</p>

<p>In short, one of the most complete course to learn Java and suitable for beginners as well as Java developers who are starting Java after a long time like last seen Java code before JDK 1.5.</p>

<p>This Coursera Specialization is for aspiring software developers with some programming experience in at least one other programming language (e.g., Python, C, JavaScript, etc.) who want to be able to solve more complex problems through objected-oriented design with Java.</p>

<p>In addition to learning Java, you will gain experience with two Java development environments (BlueJ and Eclipse), learn how to program with graphical user interfaces, and learn how to design programs capable of managing large amounts of data.</p>

<p>This is a relatively <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&subid=0&offerid=323058.1&type=10&tmpid=14538&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fjava-programming-tutorial-for-beginners%2F">new course</a> to learn Java in Udemy and that's why it's also most up-to-date. <br>
It uses tools like JShell which is introduced in Java 9 to teach you how to program in Java. No doubt, it's a great tool and really makes trying stuff in Java pretty easy.</p>

<p>The course structure is also very good and follows a step-by-step teaching method. I like the instructor's approach and teaching style, Having gone through some of his <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/02/top-5-spring-microservices-courses-with-spring-boot-and-spring-cloud.html#axzz5Cz1R4cHw">Spring courses</a> in the past.</p>

<p>The course is also very comprehensive and cover all important Java concepts like Java basics, <a href="https://dev.to/javinpaul/top-10-object-oriented-design-principles-for-writing-clean-code-4pe1">Object-Oriented Programming</a>, Java Collections, Generics, Multithreading and Concurrency, Functional Programming Networking, File handling, and Exception handling.</p>

<p>Once you have gone through a course you would be very comfortable reading and writing Java program and should also feel confident to take any <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/03/top-50-core-java-interview-questions.html">Java interview</a>, if you are learning Java to get a job.</p>

<p>In short, an excellent and <strong>most up-to-date Java course</strong> as of now and the best thing is it's free at the time of writing.</p>

<p>In Udemy, the instructor keeps their course for free some time to achieve their promotional target, after that it's converted into the paid course. So, join it now before it becomes a paid course.</p>

<p>Once you are enrolled in the course you will have free lifetime access to all its chapters and associated materials.</p>

<p>Designed for beginners, this Specialization will teach you core programming concepts and equip you to write programs to solve complex problems. In addition, you will gain the foundational skills a software engineer needs to solve real-world problems, from designing algorithms to testing and debugging your programs.</p>

<p>The specialization contains 4 courses covering Object Oriented Programming in Java, Data Structure, Advanced-Data Structure, and also covers Mastering the Software Engineering Interview course.</p>

<p>All the courses in this specialization are free-to-audit but you would need to pay money if you need a certificate which is not a bad deal.</p>

<p>This is another awesome <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&subid=0&offerid=323058.1&type=10&tmpid=14538&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fjava-in-depth-become-a-complete-java-engineer%2F">Java course</a> on Udemy which you can use to learn Java from scratch. It's a fantastic course and lived with the tile "In-Depth".</p>

<p>The Instructor has very good knowledge of Java and his explanation is awesome, which makes learning more interesting.</p>

<p>Like previous Java course, this is also very detailed and comprehensive course and covers the majority of Java topics a beginner wants to learn e.g. variables, methods, classes, collections, <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/01/top-5-free-data-structure-and-algorithm-courses-java--c-programmers.html">data structures</a>, threads, networking, etc.</p>

<p>On Downside of the course, it's mainly a slide-based course with some code examples here and there. A few more code examples, preferably with new tools like JShell will really help.</p>

  <strong>6. The Complete Java Developer Course</strong>
</h3>

<p>Though Java has changed a lot from Java SE 8, it doesn't change much in Java 9 and Java 10, hence course which covers Java 8 syntax is good and this is one of such courses.</p>

<p>Like the previous two courses, <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&subid=0&offerid=323058.1&type=10&tmpid=14538&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fjava-essential-training%2F">this course</a> also covers all essential Java topics like Variables, methods, control statements, loops, arrays and Strings, <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/08/5-object-oriented-programming-and-design-courses-for-Java-programmers.html">object-oriented programming</a>, file handling, <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/02/5-free-database-and-sql-query-courses-programmers.html">database</a>, multithreading, collections, etc.</p>

<p>It also covers functional programming and Java 8 new features along with Java FX which allows you to create GUI based Java application, much like Swing. You will even learn to build a complete Tic-Tac-Toe game in this course. In short, a good course to start with Java programming from scratch.</p>

For example, <a href="http://www.java67.com/2014/09/top-10-java-8-tutorials-best-of-lot.html">Java 8</a> was released in 2014 which completely changed how Java is written and after that we have a new Java version in every six month. </p>\n\n<p>Before you can start with <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/02/top-5-java-9-courses-to-learn-online.html#axzz5CdW6rG8R">Java 9</a> and <a href="http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/03/java-10-released-10-new-features-java.html#axzz5ALJyiIAt">Java 10</a>, you realize Java 17 is coming. But the good thing is that the core of Java is still the same and all its releases are backward compatible.</p>\n\n<p>If you are learning Java first time, then it\'s very important to choose the online course which is up-to-date, otherwise, you will be left behind in the job market and your day-to-day programming job with outdated skills.</p>\n\n<p>But, before that, let me first congratulate you on making an <strong>excellent decision of learning Java</strong>, one of the most popular main-stream programming language of the world.</p>\n\n<p>The <a href="https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/language/index.html">Java Programming language</a> is been around for more than 20+ years now and it has expanded its reach to almost every single field, from small mobile apps to large banking application running on major Investment banks.</p>\n\n<p>Java is mainly used as a server-side language to create high performance, low latency servers to handle the complex task. Java is really big on <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2011/04/top-20-core-java-interview-questions.html">Investment banks</a> which uses it to write end-to-end trading applications like front office application for trade capture, middle office applications to handle booking and allocation and back-office application for sending confirmations.</p>\n\n<p>Another area where Java really shines is for creating Android applications. Though Google has now declared <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/02/kotlin-vs-java-which-language-android.html">Kotlin</a> as the official language for <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2017/12/top-5-android-online-training-courses-for-Java-developers.html">Android app development</a>, Java is still quite big and there is no sign of any slowdown in coming years.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name="my-favorite-best-and-free-online-courses-to-learn-java-for-beginners" href="#my-favorite-best-and-free-online-courses-to-learn-java-for-beginners">\n  </a>\n  My Favorite Best and Free Online Courses to Learn Java for Beginners\n</h2>\n\n<p>In this article, I have curated some of the best Java online courses from popular online learning websites like <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Couresra</a>, <a href="https://www.udemy.com/">Udemy</a> and <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/">Pluarlsight</a>, which are both comprehensive and up-to-date but at the same time suitable for beginners. Btw, I also review courses and get paid if one of you buy the course from the link in this article.</p>\n\n<p>Without any further ado, here are them:</p>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name="1-the-complete-java-masterclass-udemy" href="#1-the-complete-java-masterclass-udemy">\n  </a>\n  1. The Complete Java Masterclass [Udemy]\n</h3>\n\n<p>This is probably the most popular <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fjava-the-complete-java-developer-course%2F">Java course</a> on Udemy with over 207,000 students enrolled in this course.</p>\n\n<p>It has got more than 40K 4.6 ratings which speak a lot about its quality but the most important thing I like about this course that instructor has frequently updated it to include changes from <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2016/10/best-books-to-learn-java-8.html">Java 8</a> and <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/02/10-books-java-developers-should-read-in.html">Java 9</a>.</p>\n\n<p>It\'s a comprehensive course with over 72 hours of material and you will learn all major things a Java developer should know like data structure, OOP, Core Java Fundamentals, Java Collections, <a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/8-best-multithreading-and-concurrency-courses-for-experienced-java-developers-8acfd3b25094">MultiThreading</a>, File IO, Networking, Database, Java 8, Unit Testing and recent Java changes.</p>\n\n<p>The instructor <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=CuIbQrBnhiw&amp;mid=39197&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fuser%2Ftimbuchalka%2F">Tim Buchalka</a> is also a famous Java instructor in Udemy and that shows with enormous social proof associated with this course. Every single concept is explained in detail and you will learn the concept one program at a time.</p>\n\n<p>You will not only learn concepts but also tools which are free like <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/02/5-free-eclipse-and-junit-online-courses-java-developers.html">Eclipse</a>, <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/02/6-free-maven-and-jenkins-online-courses-for-java-developers.html">Maven</a>, etc and essential for Java development.</p>\n\n<p>In short, one of the most complete course to learn Java and suitable for beginners as well as Java developers who are starting Java after a long time like last seen Java code before JDK 1.5.</p>\n\n<p>Learn more: <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fjava-the-complete-java-developer-course%2F"><strong>The Complete Java MasterClass</strong></a></p>\n\n<p><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;subid=0&amp;offerid=323058.1&amp;type=10&amp;tmpid=14538&amp;RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fjava-the-complete-java-developer-course%2F"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--u6GNHCOs--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0%2AtrBknsjJ_L8-4vHu.jpg" alt="best online Java course for beginners" loading="lazy" width="880" height="495"></a></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name="2-objectoriented-programming-in-java-specialization" href="#2-objectoriented-programming-in-java-specialization">\n  </a>\n  2. <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;mid=40328&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fspecializations%2Fobject-oriented-programming">Object-Oriented Programming in Java Specialization</a>\n</h3>\n\n<p>This Coursera Specialization is for aspiring software developers with some programming experience in at least one other programming language (e.g., Python, C, JavaScript, etc.) who want to be able to solve more complex problems through objected-oriented design with Java.</p>\n\n<p>In addition to learning Java, you will gain experience with two Java development environments (BlueJ and Eclipse), learn how to program with graphical user interfaces, and learn how to design programs capable of managing large amounts of data.</p>\n\n<p>Here is the link to learn more - <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;mid=40328&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fspecializations%2Fobject-oriented-programming">Object-Oriented Programming in Java Specialization</a></p>\n\n<p><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;mid=40328&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fspecializations%2Fobject-oriented-programming"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--4KaxNuXt--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera_assets/meta_images/generated/XDP/XDP%257ESPECIALIZATION%21%257Eobject-oriented-programming/XDP%257ESPECIALIZATION%21%257Eobject-oriented-programming.jpeg" alt="Object Oriented Programming in Java | Coursera" loading="lazy" width="880" height="461"></a></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name="3-java-programming-for-complete-beginners-updated-for-java-16" href="#3-java-programming-for-complete-beginners-updated-for-java-16">\n  </a>\n  3.

No doubt, it\'s a great tool and really makes trying stuff in Java pretty easy.</p>\n\n<p>The course structure is also very good and follows a step-by-step teaching method. I like the instructor\'s approach and teaching style, Having gone through some of his <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/02/top-5-spring-microservices-courses-with-spring-boot-and-spring-cloud.html#axzz5Cz1R4cHw">Spring courses</a> in the past.</p>\n\n<p>The course is also very comprehensive and cover all important Java concepts like Java basics, <a href="https://dev.to/javinpaul/top-10-object-oriented-design-principles-for-writing-clean-code-4pe1">Object-Oriented Programming</a>, Java Collections, Generics, Multithreading and Concurrency, Functional Programming Networking, File handling, and Exception handling.</p>\n\n<p>Once you have gone through a course you would be very comfortable reading and writing Java program and should also feel confident to take any <a href="http://www.java67.com/2018/03/top-50-core-java-interview-questions.html">Java interview</a>, if you are learning Java to get a job.</p>\n\n<p>In short, an excellent and <strong>most up-to-date Java course</strong> as of now and the best thing is it\'s free at the time of writing.</p>\n\n<p>In Udemy, the instructor keeps their course for free some time to achieve their promotional target, after that it\'s converted into the paid course. So, join it now before it becomes a paid course.</p>\n\n<p>Once you are enrolled in the course you will have free lifetime access to all its chapters and associated materials.</p>\n\n<p>Learn more: <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;mid=39197&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fjava-programming-tutorial-for-beginners%2F"><strong>Java Programming for Complete Beginners ---In 250 Steps</strong></a></p>\n\n<p><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;mid=39197&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fjava-programming-tutorial-for-beginners%2F"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--m4ufTXxf--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://process.fs.teachablecdn.com/ADNupMnWyR7kCWRvm76Laz/resize%3Dwidth:705/https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/DEzn1AdMR36ICT8hk761" alt="best online course to learn Java" loading="lazy" width="705" height="397"></a></p>\n\n<hr>\n<h3>\n  <a name="4-java-programming-and-software-engineering-fundamentals-specialization-certificate-on-coursera" href="#4-java-programming-and-software-engineering-fundamentals-specialization-certificate-on-coursera">\n  </a>\n  4. <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;mid=40328&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fspecializations%2Fjava-programming">Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals Specialization Certificate</a> on Coursera\n</h3>\n\n<p>Designed for beginners, this Specialization will teach you core programming concepts and equip you to write programs to solve complex problems.

For example, [Java 8](http://www.java67.com/2014/09/top-10-java-8-tutorials-best-of-lot.html) was released in 2014 which completely changed how Java is written and after that we have a new Java version in every six month. \n\nBefore you can start with [Java 9](http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/02/top-5-java-9-courses-to-learn-online.html#axzz5CdW6rG8R) and [Java 10](http://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/03/java-10-released-10-new-features-java.html#axzz5ALJyiIAt), you realize Java 17 is coming. But the good thing is that the core of Java is still the same and all its releases are backward compatible.\n\nIf you are learning Java first time, then it's very important to choose the online course which is up-to-date, otherwise, you will be left behind in the job market and your day-to-day programming job with outdated skills.\n\nBut, before that, let me first congratulate you on making an **excellent decision of learning Java**, one of the most popular main-stream programming language of the world.\n\nThe [Java Programming language](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/technotes/guides/language/index.html) is been around for more than 20+ years now and it has expanded its reach to almost every single field, from small mobile apps to large banking application running on major Investment banks.\n\nJava is mainly used as a server-side language to create high performance, low latency servers to handle the complex task. Java is really big on [Investment banks](https://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2011/04/top-20-core-java-interview-questions.html) which uses it to write end-to-end trading applications like front office application for trade capture, middle office applications to handle booking and allocation and back-office application for sending confirmations.\n\nAnother area where Java really shines is for creating Android applications. Though Google has now declared [Kotlin](https://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/02/kotlin-vs-java-which-language-android.html) as the official language for [Android app development](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2017/12/top-5-android-online-training-courses-for-Java-developers.html), Java is still quite big and there is no sign of any slowdown in coming years.\n\n## My Favorite Best and Free Online Courses to Learn Java for Beginners\nIn this article, I have curated some of the best Java online courses from popular online learning websites like [Couresra](https://www.coursera.org/), [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) and [Pluarlsight](https://www.pluralsight.com/), which are both comprehensive and up-to-date but at the same time suitable for beginners. Btw, I also review courses and get paid if one of you buy the course from the link in this article.\n\nWithout any further ado, here are them:\n\n### 1\\. The Complete Java Masterclass [Udemy]\nThis is probably the most popular [Java course](https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&subid=0&offerid=323058.1&type=10&tmpid=14538&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fjava-the-complete-java-developer-course%2F) on Udemy with over 207,000 students enrolled in this course.\n\nIt has got more than 40K 4.6 ratings which speak a lot about its quality but the most important thing I like about this course that instructor has frequently updated it to include changes from [Java 8](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2016/10/best-books-to-learn-java-8.html) and [Java 9](http://www.java67.com/2018/02/10-books-java-developers-should-read-in.html).\n\nIt's a comprehensive course with over 72 hours of material and you will learn all major things a Java developer should know like data structure, OOP, Core Java Fundamentals, Java Collections, [MultiThreading](https://medium.com/javarevisited/8-best-multithreading-and-concurrency-courses-for-experienced-java-developers-8acfd3b25094), File IO, Networking, Database, Java 8, Unit Testing and recent Java changes.\n\nThe instructor [Tim Buchalka](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=CuIbQrBnhiw&mid=39197&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fuser%2Ftimbuchalka%2F) is also a famous Java instructor in Udemy and that shows with enormous social proof associated with this course. Every single concept is explained in detail and you will learn the concept one program at a time.\n\nYou will not only learn concepts but also tools which are free like [Eclipse](http://www.java67.com/2018/02/5-free-eclipse-and-junit-online-courses-java-developers.html), [Maven](http://www.java67.com/2018/02/6-free-maven-and-jenkins-online-courses-for-java-developers.html), etc and essential for Java development.\n\nIn short, one of the most complete course to learn Java and suitable for beginners as well as Java developers who are starting Java after a long time like last seen Java code before JDK 1.5.\n\nLearn more: [**The Complete Java MasterClass**](https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&subid=0&offerid=323058.1&type=10&tmpid=14538&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fjava-the-complete-java-developer-course%2F)\n\n[![best online Java course for beginners](https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/0*trBknsjJ_L8-4vHu.jpg)](https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&subid=0&offerid=323058.1&type=10&tmpid=14538&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fjava-the-complete-java-developer-course%2F)\n\n\n---\n\n### 2\\. [Object-Oriented Programming in Java Specialization](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&mid=40328&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fspecializations%2Fobject-oriented-programming)\nThis Coursera Specialization is for aspiring software developers with some programming experience in at least one other programming language (e.g., Python, C, JavaScript, etc.) who want to be able to solve more complex problems through objected-oriented design with Java.\n\nIn addition to learning Java, you will gain experience with two Java development environments (BlueJ and Eclipse), learn how to program with graphical user interfaces, and learn how to design programs capable of managing large amounts of data.\n\nHere is the link to learn more - [Object-Oriented Programming in Java Specialization](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&mid=40328&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fspecializations%2Fobject-oriented-programming)\n\n[![Object Oriented Programming in Java | Coursera](https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera_assets/meta_images/generated/XDP/XDP~SPECIALIZATION!~object-oriented-programming/XDP~SPECIALIZATION!~object-oriented-programming.jpeg)](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&mid=40328&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fspecializations%2Fobject-oriented-programming)\n\n---\n\n### 3\\. Java Programming for Complete Beginners [Updated for Java 16]\nThis is a relatively [new course](https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&subid=0&offerid=323058.1&type=10&tmpid=14538&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fjava-programming-tutorial-for-beginners%2F) to learn Java in Udemy and that's why it's also most up-to-date. \nIt uses tools like JShell which is introduced in Java 9 to teach you how to program in Java. No doubt, it's a great tool and really makes trying stuff in Java pretty easy.\n\nThe course structure is also very good and follows a step-by-step teaching method. I like the instructor's approach and teaching style, Having gone through some of his [Spring courses](https://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/02/top-5-spring-microservices-courses-with-spring-boot-and-spring-cloud.html#axzz5Cz1R4cHw) in the past.\n\nThe course is also very comprehensive and cover all important Java concepts like Java basics, [Object-Oriented Programming](https://dev.to/javinpaul/top-10-object-oriented-design-principles-for-writing-clean-code-4pe1), Java Collections, Generics, Multithreading and Concurrency, Functional Programming Networking, File handling, and Exception handling.\n\nOnce you have gone through a course you would be very comfortable reading and writing Java program and should also feel confident to take any [Java interview](http://www.java67.com/2018/03/top-50-core-java-interview-questions.html), if you are learning Java to get a job.\n\nIn short, an excellent and **most up-to-date Java course** as of now and the best thing is it's free at the time of writing.\n\nIn Udemy, the instructor keeps their course for free some time to achieve their promotional target, after that it's converted into the paid course. So, join it now before it becomes a paid course.\n\nOnce you are enrolled in the course you will have free lifetime access to all its chapters and associated materials.\n\nLearn more: [**Java Programming for Complete Beginners ---In 250 Steps**](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&mid=39197&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fjava-programming-tutorial-for-beginners%2F)\n\n[![best online course to learn Java](https://process.fs.teachablecdn.com/ADNupMnWyR7kCWRvm76Laz/resize=width:705/https://www.filepicker.io/api/file/DEzn1AdMR36ICT8hk761)](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&mid=39197&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fjava-programming-tutorial-for-beginners%2F)\n\n---\n\n### 4.

In addition, you will gain the foundational skills a software engineer needs to solve real-world problems, from designing algorithms to testing and debugging your programs.\n\nThe specialization contains 4 courses covering Object Oriented Programming in Java, Data Structure, Advanced-Data Structure, and also covers Mastering the Software Engineering Interview course.\n\nAll the courses in this specialization are free-to-audit but you would need to pay money if you need a certificate which is not a bad deal.\n\nHere is the link to join this course - [Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals Specialization](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&mid=40328&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fspecializations%2Fjava-programming) \n\n[![Java Programming and Software Engineering Fundamentals | Coursera](https://s3.amazonaws.com/coursera_assets/meta_images/generated/XDP/XDP~SPECIALIZATION!~java-programming/XDP~SPECIALIZATION!~java-programming.jpeg)](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&mid=40328&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Fspecializations%2Fjava-programming)]\n\n---\n\n\n### 5\\. Java In-Depth: Become a Complete Java Engineer!\nThis is another awesome [Java course](https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&subid=0&offerid=323058.1&type=10&tmpid=14538&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fjava-in-depth-become-a-complete-java-engineer%2F) on Udemy which you can use to learn Java from scratch. It's a fantastic course and lived with the tile \"In-Depth\".\n\nThe Instructor has very good knowledge of Java and his explanation is awesome, which makes learning more interesting.\n\nLike previous Java course, this is also very detailed and comprehensive course and covers the majority of Java topics a beginner wants to learn e.g. variables, methods, classes, collections, [data structures](https://javarevisited.blogspot.sg/2018/01/top-5-free-data-structure-and-algorithm-courses-java--c-programmers.html), threads, networking, etc.\n\nOn Downside of the course, it's mainly a slide-based course with some code examples here and there. A few more code examples, preferably with new tools like JShell will really help.\n\nLearn more: [**Java In-Depth: Become a Complete Java Engineer!**](https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&subid=0&offerid=323058.1&type=10&tmpid=14538&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fjava-in-depth-become-a-complete-java-engineer%2F)\n\n[![best udemy course to learn Java](https://miro.medium.com/max/348/0*lo_hwmGTdN3hX-K3.jpg)](https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&subid=0&offerid=323058.1&type=10&tmpid=14538&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fjava-in-depth-become-a-complete-java-engineer%2F)\n\n---\n\n\n### **6\\. The Complete Java Developer Course**\nThough Java has changed a lot from Java SE 8, it doesn't change much in Java 9 and Java 10, hence course which covers Java 8 syntax is good and this is one of such courses.\n\nLike the previous two courses, [this course](https://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/click?id=JVFxdTr9V80&subid=0&offerid=323058.1&type=10&tmpid=14538&RD_PARM1=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fjava-essential-training%2F) also covers all essential Java topics like Variables, methods, control statements, loops, arrays and Strings, [object-oriented programming](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/08/5-object-oriented-programming-and-design-courses-for-Java-programmers.html), file handling, [database](http://www.java67.com/2018/02/5-free-database-and-sql-query-courses-programmers.html), multithreading, collections, etc.\n\nIt also covers functional programming and Java 8 new features along with Java FX which allows you to create GUI based Java application, much like Swing. You will even learn to build a complete Tic-Tac-Toe game in this course.
