<p>Hello Devs, if you want to become a Cloud expert in 2022 and looking for best Cloud computing courses then you have come to the right place. In the past, I have shared <a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/10-best-python-3-courses-on-udemy-ddd4e3ec5dbf">best Python courses</a> and <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/07/top-5-online-courses-to-learn-blockchain.html#axzz6tFYADc00">best Blockchain courses</a> and today I will share similar resources to learn Cloud computing in 2022. </p>

<p>Cloud Computing is becoming an essential skill for any Software developer or IT professional today as more and more companies are moving towards Cloud for their infrastructure and service needs. It pays to <em>learn Cloud Computing today</em> as the most likely application will be solely built and deployed in the Cloud in the future. </p>

<p>No matter what your role is, if you are working in technology, cloud computing will affect you, one way or another. </p>

<p>Anyway, if you want to learn cloud computing, you have come to the right place; in this article, I will share some of the best courses to learn Cloud computing basics in general and with <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/05/top-5-courses-to-crack-aws-solutions-architect-associate-certification-exam-SAA-C01.html">AWS</a> and <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/07/top-5-google-cloud-platform-gcp-courses-certifications-online.html">GCP</a> in particular.</p>

<p>To be honest, I have had a tough time finding an excellent course to learn Cloud Computing; after trying a handful of courses on <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/08/top-10-udemy-courses-and-certifications-for-programmers.html">Udemy</a>, <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/10/udemy-vs-pluralsight-review-which-is-better-to-learn-code.html">Pluralsight</a>, <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/01/top-10-free-interactive-online-courses.html">Educative</a>, and <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/02/10-best-coursera-courses--for-python.html">Coursera</a>, I have finally zeroed down on following five directions to learn the basics of Cloud Computing.</p>

<p>These courses provide a broad introduction to all aspects of cloud computing, but before going to see these courses let's first understand what it is Cloud and what benefit it provides? What problem does Cloud solve, and why is there so much buzz about it?</p>

<p>Cloud has a different meaning for different people and is also used to refer to other things in a different context, but in general, the Cloud means a host of services that are ready to use for your application. </p>

<p>Many Cloud service provider companies like AWS (<a href="https://hackernoon.com/top-5-amazon-web-services-or-aws-courses-to-learn-online-free-and-best-of-lot-d94e192054b7">Amazon Web Service</a>), GCP (<a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/07/top-5-courses-to-become-google-cloud-professional-architect.html">Google Cloud Platform</a>, and <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/02/top-5-AZ-900-exam-Azure-Fundamentals-certification-practice-tests-and-mock-exams-to.html">Microsoft Azure</a> provide these services.</p>

<p>Now, what are those services? Well, these could be servers, networks, storage, computing power, and other infra-related services commonly offered and referred to as <strong>IaaS</strong> (Infrastructure as service). There are other cloud models, like *<em>PaaS *</em>(Platform as Service) and *<em>SaaS *</em>(Software as service), but let's focus on IaaS first to understand the benefits provided by Cloud.</p>

<p>Not long ago, to host a real-world E-commerce application, you needed to buy servers, networks, and storage and set them up to your requirements, like installing the required software and <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2021/08/top-5-courses-to-learn-operating-system.html">operating system</a>.</p>

<p>Most of the companies have their own Data Center where these servers are kept, and there was a high cost involved to keep those data centers running.</p>

<p>It was just the initial time and cost for setting up the server. Their utilization was also poor; secondary servers are often idle, just wasting that precious CPU and memory power. The effect was more evident on big companies that own thousands of servers across multiple data centers worldwide.</p>

<p>Amazon was one such company that quickly realized that by using virtualization, they could use the computing power of their infrastructure, giving birth to the Cloud. </p>

<p>You can spin up a <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/12/top-5-free-microsoft-sql-server-and-transact-sql-online-courses.html#axzz5hG3koJem">server</a>, <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/05/top-5-sql-and-database-courses-to-learn-online.html">database</a>, and network in the Cloud very quickly with just some clicks, and you will only be charged for whatever you use. So this solves the problem of setup, utilization, and scalability.</p>

</h3>

<p>When I started learning about Cloud, it was a very abstract thing for me; I couldn't understand what the Cloud was and why everyone talked about it. It was like a person without a face, but when I learned about AWS, I could co-relate various cloud concepts very quickly.</p>

<p>So, AWS is like putting a face on Cloud, and that's why I recommend this course for anyone starting to learn about Cloud.</p>

<p>This course explains key concepts of clouds like Iaas, PaaS, and Saas with AWS examples, making it easy to learn what Cloud is and what benefits it offers.</p>

<p>Knowing AWS is also a plus because it's one of the most popular Cloud platforms, and your experience with AWS will also boost your CV for any AWS job or for a developer job where <a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/11-essential-skills-to-become-software-developer-in-2020-c617e293e90e">AWS skills</a> are desired.</p>

<p>Talking about social proof, this course is created by Infinite Skills and has, on average, 4.2 ratings from close to 2400 students, which is excellent. I recommend these books for absolute beginners who want to learn about Cloud computing in general and with AWS.</p>

In the past, I have shared <a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/10-best-python-3-courses-on-udemy-ddd4e3ec5dbf">best Python courses</a> and <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/07/top-5-online-courses-to-learn-blockchain.html#axzz6tFYADc00">best Blockchain courses</a> and today I will share similar resources to learn Cloud computing in 2022. </p>\n\n<p>Cloud Computing is becoming an essential skill for any Software developer or IT professional today as more and more companies are moving towards Cloud for their infrastructure and service needs. It pays to <em>learn Cloud Computing today</em> as the most likely application will be solely built and deployed in the Cloud in the future. </p>\n\n<p>No matter what your role is, if you are working in technology, cloud computing will affect you, one way or another. </p>\n\n<p>Anyway, if you want to learn cloud computing, you have come to the right place; in this article, I will share some of the best courses to learn Cloud computing basics in general and with <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/05/top-5-courses-to-crack-aws-solutions-architect-associate-certification-exam-SAA-C01.html">AWS</a> and <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/07/top-5-google-cloud-platform-gcp-courses-certifications-online.html">GCP</a> in particular.</p>\n\n<p>To be honest, I have had a tough time finding an excellent course to learn Cloud Computing; after trying a handful of courses on <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/08/top-10-udemy-courses-and-certifications-for-programmers.html">Udemy</a>, <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/10/udemy-vs-pluralsight-review-which-is-better-to-learn-code.html">Pluralsight</a>, <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/01/top-10-free-interactive-online-courses.html">Educative</a>, and <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/02/10-best-coursera-courses--for-python.html">Coursera</a>, I have finally zeroed down on following five directions to learn the basics of Cloud Computing.</p>\n\n<p>These courses provide a broad introduction to all aspects of cloud computing, but before going to see these courses let\'s first understand what it is Cloud and what benefit it provides? What problem does Cloud solve, and why is there so much buzz about it?</p>\n\n<p>Cloud has a different meaning for different people and is also used to refer to other things in a different context, but in general, the Cloud means a host of services that are ready to use for your application. </p>\n\n<p>Many Cloud service provider companies like AWS (<a href="https://hackernoon.com/top-5-amazon-web-services-or-aws-courses-to-learn-online-free-and-best-of-lot-d94e192054b7">Amazon Web Service</a>), GCP (<a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/07/top-5-courses-to-become-google-cloud-professional-architect.html">Google Cloud Platform</a>, and <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/02/top-5-AZ-900-exam-Azure-Fundamentals-certification-practice-tests-and-mock-exams-to.html">Microsoft Azure</a> provide these services.</p>\n\n<p>Now, what are those services? Well, these could be servers, networks, storage, computing power, and other infra-related services commonly offered and referred to as <strong>IaaS</strong> (Infrastructure as service). There are other cloud models, like *<em>PaaS *</em>(Platform as Service) and *<em>SaaS *</em>(Software as service), but let\'s focus on IaaS first to understand the benefits provided by Cloud.</p>\n\n<p>Not long ago, to host a real-world E-commerce application, you needed to buy servers, networks, and storage and set them up to your requirements, like installing the required software and <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2021/08/top-5-courses-to-learn-operating-system.html">operating system</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Most of the companies have their own Data Center where these servers are kept, and there was a high cost involved to keep those data centers running.</p>\n\n<p>It was just the initial time and cost for setting up the server. Their utilization was also poor; secondary servers are often idle, just wasting that precious CPU and memory power. The effect was more evident on big companies that own thousands of servers across multiple data centers worldwide.</p>\n\n<p>Amazon was one such company that quickly realized that by using virtualization, they could use the computing power of their infrastructure, giving birth to the Cloud. </p>\n\n<p>You can spin up a <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/12/top-5-free-microsoft-sql-server-and-transact-sql-online-courses.html#axzz5hG3koJem">server</a>, <a href="https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/05/top-5-sql-and-database-courses-to-learn-online.html">database</a>, and network in the Cloud very quickly with just some clicks, and you will only be charged for whatever you use. So this solves the problem of setup, utilization, and scalability.</p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name="5-best-online-courses-to-learn-cloud-computing-for-beginners-in-2022" href="#5-best-online-courses-to-learn-cloud-computing-for-beginners-in-2022">\n  </a>\n  5 Best Online Courses to Learn Cloud Computing for Beginners in 2022\n</h2>\n\n<p>Now that you know what Cloud is and what benefits it offers in terms of cost, ease of setup, efficiency, and scalability, it\'s time to deep dive and goes through these online training courses, which will help you learn Cloud Computing fundamentals better.</p>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name="1-introduction-to-cloud-computing-on-amazon-aws-for-beginners-udemy" href="#1-introduction-to-cloud-computing-on-amazon-aws-for-beginners-udemy">\n  </a>\n  1. <a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;mid=39197&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fintroduction-to-cloud-computing-on-amazon-aws-for-beginners%2F">Introduction to Cloud Computing on Amazon AWS for Beginners</a> [Udemy]\n</h3>\n\n<p>When I started learning about Cloud, it was a very abstract thing for me; I couldn\'t understand what the Cloud was and why everyone talked about it. It was like a person without a face, but when I learned about AWS, I could co-relate various cloud concepts very quickly.</p>\n\n<p>So, AWS is like putting a face on Cloud, and that\'s why I recommend this course for anyone starting to learn about Cloud.</p>\n\n<p>This course explains key concepts of clouds like Iaas, PaaS, and Saas with AWS examples, making it easy to learn what Cloud is and what benefits it offers.</p>\n\n<p>Knowing AWS is also a plus because it\'s one of the most popular Cloud platforms, and your experience with AWS will also boost your CV for any AWS job or for a developer job where <a href="https://medium.com/javarevisited/11-essential-skills-to-become-software-developer-in-2020-c617e293e90e">AWS skills</a> are desired.</p>\n\n<p>Talking about social proof, this course is created by Infinite Skills and has, on average, 4.2 ratings from close to 2400 students, which is excellent. I recommend these books for absolute beginners who want to learn about Cloud computing in general and with AWS.</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&amp;mid=39197&amp;murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fintroduction-to-cloud-computing-on-amazon-aws-for-beginners%2F"><img src="https://res.cloudinary.com/practicaldev/image/fetch/s--xzhqtpq6--/c_limit%2Cf_auto%2Cfl_progressive%2Cq_auto%2Cw_880/https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1YnWDG52KNI/YGa9dBRz68I/AAAAAAAAm00/n4pOUh6WsZA1ftJVkpZTpoECr29UowwwwCLcBGAsYHQ/w463-h274/image.png" alt="Best Cloud Computing Course for Beginners" loading="lazy" width="463" height="274"></a></p>\n\n\n<hr>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name="2-cloud-computing-concepts-by-coursera" href="#2-cloud-computing-concepts-by-coursera">\n  </a>\n  2. <a href="https://coursera.pxf.io/c/3294490/1164545/14726?u=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.coursera.org%2Flearn%2Fcloud-computing">Cloud Computing Concepts by Coursera</a>**\n</h3>\n\n<p>This is one of the best online courses to learn about Cloud Computing on Coursera.

In the past, I have shared [best Python courses](https://medium.com/javarevisited/10-best-python-3-courses-on-udemy-ddd4e3ec5dbf) and [best Blockchain courses](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/07/top-5-online-courses-to-learn-blockchain.html#axzz6tFYADc00) and today I will share similar resources to learn Cloud computing in 2022. \n\nCloud Computing is becoming an essential skill for any Software developer or IT professional today as more and more companies are moving towards Cloud for their infrastructure and service needs. It pays to *learn Cloud Computing today* as the most likely application will be solely built and deployed in the Cloud in the future. \n\nNo matter what your role is, if you are working in technology, cloud computing will affect you, one way or another. \n\nAnyway, if you want to learn cloud computing, you have come to the right place; in this article, I will share some of the best courses to learn Cloud computing basics in general and with [AWS](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/05/top-5-courses-to-crack-aws-solutions-architect-associate-certification-exam-SAA-C01.html) and [GCP](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/07/top-5-google-cloud-platform-gcp-courses-certifications-online.html) in particular.\n\nTo be honest, I have had a tough time finding an excellent course to learn Cloud Computing; after trying a handful of courses on [Udemy](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/08/top-10-udemy-courses-and-certifications-for-programmers.html), [Pluralsight](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2019/10/udemy-vs-pluralsight-review-which-is-better-to-learn-code.html), [Educative](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/01/top-10-free-interactive-online-courses.html), and [Coursera](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/02/10-best-coursera-courses--for-python.html), I have finally zeroed down on following five directions to learn the basics of Cloud Computing.\n\nThese courses provide a broad introduction to all aspects of cloud computing, but before going to see these courses let's first understand what it is Cloud and what benefit it provides? What problem does Cloud solve, and why is there so much buzz about it?\n\nCloud has a different meaning for different people and is also used to refer to other things in a different context, but in general, the Cloud means a host of services that are ready to use for your application. \n\nMany Cloud service provider companies like AWS ([Amazon Web Service](https://hackernoon.com/top-5-amazon-web-services-or-aws-courses-to-learn-online-free-and-best-of-lot-d94e192054b7)), GCP ([Google Cloud Platform](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/07/top-5-courses-to-become-google-cloud-professional-architect.html), and [Microsoft Azure](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2020/02/top-5-AZ-900-exam-Azure-Fundamentals-certification-practice-tests-and-mock-exams-to.html) provide these services.\n\nNow, what are those services? Well, these could be servers, networks, storage, computing power, and other infra-related services commonly offered and referred to as **IaaS** (Infrastructure as service). There are other cloud models, like **PaaS **(Platform as Service) and **SaaS **(Software as service), but let's focus on IaaS first to understand the benefits provided by Cloud.\n\nNot long ago, to host a real-world E-commerce application, you needed to buy servers, networks, and storage and set them up to your requirements, like installing the required software and [operating system](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2021/08/top-5-courses-to-learn-operating-system.html).\n\nMost of the companies have their own Data Center where these servers are kept, and there was a high cost involved to keep those data centers running.\n\nIt was just the initial time and cost for setting up the server. Their utilization was also poor; secondary servers are often idle, just wasting that precious CPU and memory power. The effect was more evident on big companies that own thousands of servers across multiple data centers worldwide.\n\nAmazon was one such company that quickly realized that by using virtualization, they could use the computing power of their infrastructure, giving birth to the Cloud. \n\nYou can spin up a [server](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/12/top-5-free-microsoft-sql-server-and-transact-sql-online-courses.html#axzz5hG3koJem), [database](https://javarevisited.blogspot.com/2018/05/top-5-sql-and-database-courses-to-learn-online.html), and network in the Cloud very quickly with just some clicks, and you will only be charged for whatever you use. So this solves the problem of setup, utilization, and scalability.\n\n-------\n\n\n## 5 Best Online Courses to Learn Cloud Computing for Beginners in 2022\nNow that you know what Cloud is and what benefits it offers in terms of cost, ease of setup, efficiency, and scalability, it's time to deep dive and goes through these online training courses, which will help you learn Cloud Computing fundamentals better.\n\n### 1\\.

It was like a person without a face, but when I learned about AWS, I could co-relate various cloud concepts very quickly.\n\nSo, AWS is like putting a face on Cloud, and that's why I recommend this course for anyone starting to learn about Cloud.\n\nThis course explains key concepts of clouds like Iaas, PaaS, and Saas with AWS examples, making it easy to learn what Cloud is and what benefits it offers.\n\nKnowing AWS is also a plus because it's one of the most popular Cloud platforms, and your experience with AWS will also boost your CV for any AWS job or for a developer job where [AWS skills](https://medium.com/javarevisited/11-essential-skills-to-become-software-developer-in-2020-c617e293e90e) are desired.\n\nTalking about social proof, this course is created by Infinite Skills and has, on average, 4.2 ratings from close to 2400 students, which is excellent. I recommend these books for absolute beginners who want to learn about Cloud computing in general and with AWS.\n\n[![Best Cloud Computing Course for Beginners](https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/-1YnWDG52KNI/YGa9dBRz68I/AAAAAAAAm00/n4pOUh6WsZA1ftJVkpZTpoECr29UowwwwCLcBGAsYHQ/w463-h274/image.png)](https://click.linksynergy.com/deeplink?id=JVFxdTr9V80&mid=39197&murl=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.udemy.com%2Fcourse%2Fintroduction-to-cloud-computing-on-amazon-aws-for-beginners%2F)\n\n-------\n\n\n\n###2\\.
