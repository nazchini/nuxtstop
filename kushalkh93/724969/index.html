(ba dum tss) With tech, frameworks, and programming best practices changing every day—even the best developers risk falling behind. </p>

<p>Nobody really wants to dedicate large chunks of their time to continued education. We get that. Fortunately, the internet is littered with developer blogs. And, we can definitely innovate, grow and learn from the trials and errors of others so we don't have to waste time ourselves.</p>

<p>If you're part of team "Never Stop Learning", check out some of our favorite developer blogs:</p>

<h2>
  <a name="1-stack-overflow" href="#1-stack-overflow">
  </a>
  1. Stack Overflow
</h2>

<p>With over 100 million visitors each month, Stack Overflow is one of the most popular websites in the world. In this case, the popularity is well deserved. The question-and-answer website for developers was built around the idea of knowledge sharing and reuse. It encourages its readers to reuse what others have already learned, created and proven to build new things of value. An emphasis on two-way conversation and altruistic mentorship makes Stack Overflow much more than a developer blog—it’s a powerful developer community. </p>

<p>Recommended blog: If you’re like every other developer in the world <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/questions/927358/how-do-i-undo-the-most-recent-local-commits-in-git?utm_source=dev.to&utm_medium=article&utm_campaign=developerblogs&utm_term=stackoverflow&utm_content=this%20question">this question</a> may interest you. (Okay, technically it has only been viewed 9.5 million times)</p>
