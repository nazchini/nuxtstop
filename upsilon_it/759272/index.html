<hr>

<p>Content has become a number one driver in customer engagement. Companies are now looking for a way to future-proof their digital experience architecture, enabling omnichannel support for their customers available today and in the future. At the same time, it is essential to give developers, managers, and content creators the possibility to create more interactive experiences for customers with less investment of money and time, offering businesses a competitive edge. As a result, there is a demand for agile and flexible software to effectively manage vast amounts of digital content. And here is where a headless CMS with all its killer features comes to the fore.</p>

<h2>
  <a name="what-is-a-headless-cms" href="#what-is-a-headless-cms">
  </a>
  What is a headless CMS?
</h2>

<p>The term ‘headless’ comes from the concept of chopping the ‘head’ (the front end, i.e., the website or app) off the ‘body’ (the back end, i.e., the content repository, database, etc.). So a headless CMS is a back-end-only CMS built from the ground up as a content repository that delivers content from databases (SQL and NoSQL) and files to any platform or device via API. </p>

<p>A headless CMS remains with an interface to manage content and a RESTful or GraphQL API to deliver content wherever you need it. The main focus of headless CMS is on storing and delivering structured content and allowing content editors to collaborate on new content.  In a headless CMS, the responsibility of content presentation and layout is given to the delivery channels. Due to this approach, a headless CMS does not care about how and where your content is displayed. It enables each channel to represent the content in its own individual way. </p>

<p>The demand for a headless CMS among business owners is constantly growing. The reason for this is the benefits it can bring to your business. Among the main advantages of headless CMS over a traditional one are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Flexibility: Delivery channels that ultimately use content from the CMS build the layout and presentation layers in their own individual way using their favorite tools and frameworks. As a result, it creates a unique user experience. </li>
<li>Focus on content: A headless CMS comes with a well-defined API, thus, allocating more time for content creation and storage rather than managing and presenting it.</li>
<li>Compatibility: It gives the ability to distribute content across various platforms and devices from a single backend.</li>
<li>Security: As the Content publishing environment isn’t accessible from the database, using this will prevent malware attacks.</li>
<li>Scalability: front-end and backend are detached, so there is no additional time needed for maintenance. You can make customized digital assets and upgrade them without affecting the performance of the entire system.</li>
<li>Control: Developers can integrate with any codebase and use any preferred language of their choice.</li>
</ul>

<p>Today, we see a growing interest from businesses toward headless CMS aided by new software architecture trends, enhanced AI capabilities to deliver personalized content, headless commerce tools that create new choices and customization options for users. However, not all companies can pin down a reliable solution that’s equipped to fuel their unique and specific digital presence for the foreseeable future due to the large CMS market supply. </p>

<p>To help you, we have identified several types of headless CMS for different business requirements and compiled a list of the most popular headless CMS. So you can learn more about the alternatives, compare features, and narrow down your search based on the pros and cons of each platform to choose the best headless CMS for your company. </p>

  </a>
  Types of headless CMS. SaaS (cloud-hosted) and On-premise (self-hosted) solutions.
</h2>

<p>If we were to split Headless CMS into two categories, we have SaaS and on-premise CMS based on the type of hosting. </p>

<h3>
  <a name="what-is-an-onpremise-cms" href="#what-is-an-onpremise-cms">
  </a>
  What is an on-premise CMS?
</h3>

<p>On-premise solutions are software that is installed and run on individuals computers or the organization using the software. You download it, install on your choice of server and complete the initial setup. With this comes the individual responsibility for the website infrastructure and its software dependencies like databases, necessary software libraries, and more. On-premise CMS can be run locally on your own computer for free, or, if you want to be able to access it from outside of this environment, you can install it on a server with a hosting service for a small monthly fee. </p>

<h3>
  <a name="what-are-the-benefits-of-investing-in-an-onpremise-cms" href="#what-are-the-benefits-of-investing-in-an-onpremise-cms">
  </a>
  What are the benefits of investing in an on-premise CMS?
</h3>

<p>There are several reasons why using on-premise CMS is better than going with cloud-hosted solutions. They include the following:</p>

<ul>
<li>You have full control over data. It makes your business GDPR-compliant.</li>
<li>You host the website. Thus, you are in complete control of the website customization and have more freedom in its management.
</li>
<li>It can efficiently work without any updates and plugins, if you don’t want to install them.</li>
<li>Ability to extend the backend API services and the Admin Panel GUI with your own custom features.</li>
</ul>

<h3>
  <a name="what-is-a-saas-cms" href="#what-is-a-saas-cms">
  </a>
  What is a SaaS CMS?
</h3>

<p>Simply put, a SaaS CMS is software that exists entirely in a cloud environment. In this case, the solution is provided as a service, reducing the need to support the website infrastructure by software infrastructure and IT teams as it happens with an on-premise CMS. </p>

<p>The "service" part of SaaS CMS means that the vendor will handle all the questions with upgrading, maintaining, or hosting the website or apps. It allows you to focus on more pressing issues. It can become a problem for companies that deal with sensitive data regularly and don't want to transfer the security of their data to a third-party company. At the same time, maintaining high levels of security compliance across your own website does take a lot of work, so eventually it might be easier for businesses to find a trustworthy vendor with a strong history of client satisfaction to take care of their platform. </p>

<h3>
  <a name="why-use-a-saas-cms" href="#why-use-a-saas-cms">
  </a>
  Why use a SaaS CMS?
</h3>

<p>While the type of hosting is the primary difference between SaaS and on-premise CMS, it only scratches the surface of SaaS benefits. Some of the resulting benefits of SaaS CMS are:</p>

<ul>
<li>Seamless upgrades and enhancements: You get the most up-to-date version of the software without needing to re-implement your solution because all releases and updates are the responsibility of your vendor.</li>
<li>Speed to innovation: This CMS offers content admins increased speed to market and reduced friction. Moreover, it makes the adoption to new market trends much easier as the entire change process is streamlined. </li>
<li>Simplified maintenance and management: When you move to a SaaS CMS, your vendor typically takes care of maintaining the system and ensuring it’s secure and scalable.</li>
<li>Increased time to value: Efficient and simple installation gets your experiences live faster. </li>
</ul>

<p>Each kind of headless CMS can be considered for different business purposes and project requirements. When you decide on the type of hosting, you will face the question of choosing a platform with headless functionality. Further, we will explore some of the best available SaaS and on-premise headless CMS options. We will pay attention to the features offered by each option and the main differences between them.</p>

Companies are now looking for a way to future-proof their digital experience architecture, enabling omnichannel support for their customers available today and in the future. At the same time, it is essential to give developers, managers, and content creators the possibility to create more interactive experiences for customers with less investment of money and time, offering businesses a competitive edge. As a result, there is a demand for agile and flexible software to effectively manage vast amounts of digital content. And here is where a headless CMS with all its killer features comes to the fore.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name="what-is-a-headless-cms" href="#what-is-a-headless-cms">\n  </a>\n  What is a headless CMS?\n</h2>\n\n<p>The term ‘headless’ comes from the concept of chopping the ‘head’ (the front end, i.e., the website or app) off the ‘body’ (the back end, i.e., the content repository, database, etc.). So a headless CMS is a back-end-only CMS built from the ground up as a content repository that delivers content from databases (SQL and NoSQL) and files to any platform or device via API. </p>\n\n<p>A headless CMS remains with an interface to manage content and a RESTful or GraphQL API to deliver content wherever you need it. The main focus of headless CMS is on storing and delivering structured content and allowing content editors to collaborate on new content.  In a headless CMS, the responsibility of content presentation and layout is given to the delivery channels. Due to this approach, a headless CMS does not care about how and where your content is displayed. It enables each channel to represent the content in its own individual way. </p>\n\n<p>The demand for a headless CMS among business owners is constantly growing. The reason for this is the benefits it can bring to your business. Among the main advantages of headless CMS over a traditional one are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Flexibility: Delivery channels that ultimately use content from the CMS build the layout and presentation layers in their own individual way using their favorite tools and frameworks. As a result, it creates a unique user experience. </li>\n<li>Focus on content: A headless CMS comes with a well-defined API, thus, allocating more time for content creation and storage rather than managing and presenting it.</li>\n<li>Compatibility: It gives the ability to distribute content across various platforms and devices from a single backend.</li>\n<li>Security: As the Content publishing environment isn’t accessible from the database, using this will prevent malware attacks.</li>\n<li>Scalability: front-end and backend are detached, so there is no additional time needed for maintenance. You can make customized digital assets and upgrade them without affecting the performance of the entire system.</li>\n<li>Control: Developers can integrate with any codebase and use any preferred language of their choice.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Today, we see a growing interest from businesses toward headless CMS aided by new software architecture trends, enhanced AI capabilities to deliver personalized content, headless commerce tools that create new choices and customization options for users. However, not all companies can pin down a reliable solution that’s equipped to fuel their unique and specific digital presence for the foreseeable future due to the large CMS market supply. </p>\n\n<p>To help you, we have identified several types of headless CMS for different business requirements and compiled a list of the most popular headless CMS. So you can learn more about the alternatives, compare features, and narrow down your search based on the pros and cons of each platform to choose the best headless CMS for your company. </p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name="types-of-headless-cms-saas-cloudhosted-and-onpremise-selfhosted-solutions" href="#types-of-headless-cms-saas-cloudhosted-and-onpremise-selfhosted-solutions">\n  </a>\n  Types of headless CMS. SaaS (cloud-hosted) and On-premise (self-hosted) solutions.\n</h2>\n\n<p>If we were to split Headless CMS into two categories, we have SaaS and on-premise CMS based on the type of hosting. </p>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name="what-is-an-onpremise-cms" href="#what-is-an-onpremise-cms">\n  </a>\n  What is an on-premise CMS?\n</h3>\n\n<p>On-premise solutions are software that is installed and run on individuals computers or the organization using the software. You download it, install on your choice of server and complete the initial setup. With this comes the individual responsibility for the website infrastructure and its software dependencies like databases, necessary software libraries, and more. On-premise CMS can be run locally on your own computer for free, or, if you want to be able to access it from outside of this environment, you can install it on a server with a hosting service for a small monthly fee. </p>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name="what-are-the-benefits-of-investing-in-an-onpremise-cms" href="#what-are-the-benefits-of-investing-in-an-onpremise-cms">\n  </a>\n  What are the benefits of investing in an on-premise CMS?\n</h3>\n\n<p>There are several reasons why using on-premise CMS is better than going with cloud-hosted solutions. They include the following:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>You have full control over data. It makes your business GDPR-compliant.</li>\n<li>You host the website. Thus, you are in complete control of the website customization and have more freedom in its management.\n</li>\n<li>It can efficiently work without any updates and plugins, if you don’t want to install them.</li>\n<li>Ability to extend the backend API services and the Admin Panel GUI with your own custom features.</li>\n</ul>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name="what-is-a-saas-cms" href="#what-is-a-saas-cms">\n  </a>\n  What is a SaaS CMS?\n</h3>\n\n<p>Simply put, a SaaS CMS is software that exists entirely in a cloud environment. In this case, the solution is provided as a service, reducing the need to support the website infrastructure by software infrastructure and IT teams as it happens with an on-premise CMS. </p>\n\n<p>The "service" part of SaaS CMS means that the vendor will handle all the questions with upgrading, maintaining, or hosting the website or apps. It allows you to focus on more pressing issues. It can become a problem for companies that deal with sensitive data regularly and don\'t want to transfer the security of their data to a third-party company. At the same time, maintaining high levels of security compliance across your own website does take a lot of work, so eventually it might be easier for businesses to find a trustworthy vendor with a strong history of client satisfaction to take care of their platform. </p>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name="why-use-a-saas-cms" href="#why-use-a-saas-cms">\n  </a>\n  Why use a SaaS CMS?\n</h3>\n\n<p>While the type of hosting is the primary difference between SaaS and on-premise CMS, it only scratches the surface of SaaS benefits. Some of the resulting benefits of SaaS CMS are:</p>\n\n<ul>\n<li>Seamless upgrades and enhancements: You get the most up-to-date version of the software without needing to re-implement your solution because all releases and updates are the responsibility of your vendor.</li>\n<li>Speed to innovation: This CMS offers content admins increased speed to market and reduced friction. Moreover, it makes the adoption to new market trends much easier as the entire change process is streamlined. </li>\n<li>Simplified maintenance and management: When you move to a SaaS CMS, your vendor typically takes care of maintaining the system and ensuring it’s secure and scalable.</li>\n<li>Increased time to value: Efficient and simple installation gets your experiences live faster. </li>\n</ul>\n\n<p>Each kind of headless CMS can be considered for different business purposes and project requirements. When you decide on the type of hosting, you will face the question of choosing a platform with headless functionality. Further, we will explore some of the best available SaaS and on-premise headless CMS options. We will pay attention to the features offered by each option and the main differences between them.</p>\n\n<h2>\n  <a name="top-headless-cms-2021-comparison" href="#top-headless-cms-2021-comparison">\n  </a>\n  Top Headless CMS 2021 Comparison\n</h2>\n\n<h3>\n  <a name="netlifycms" href="#netlifycms">\n  </a>\n  NetlifyCMS\n</h3>\n\n<p><strong>SaaS or on-premise?</strong> On-premise.</p>\n\n<p><a href="https://www.netlifycms.org/">NetlifyCMS</a>  is one of the most popular Git-based platform in the headless CMS ecosystem.

Companies are now looking for a way to future-proof their digital experience architecture, enabling omnichannel support for their customers available today and in the future. At the same time, it is essential to give developers, managers, and content creators the possibility to create more interactive experiences for customers with less investment of money and time, offering businesses a competitive edge. As a result, there is a demand for agile and flexible software to effectively manage vast amounts of digital content. And here is where a headless CMS with all its killer features comes to the fore.\n\n##What is a headless CMS? \n\nThe term ‘headless’ comes from the concept of chopping the ‘head’ (the front end, i.e., the website or app) off the ‘body’ (the back end, i.e., the content repository, database, etc.). So a headless CMS is a back-end-only CMS built from the ground up as a content repository that delivers content from databases (SQL and NoSQL) and files to any platform or device via API. \n\nA headless CMS remains with an interface to manage content and a RESTful or GraphQL API to deliver content wherever you need it. The main focus of headless CMS is on storing and delivering structured content and allowing content editors to collaborate on new content.  In a headless CMS, the responsibility of content presentation and layout is given to the delivery channels. Due to this approach, a headless CMS does not care about how and where your content is displayed. It enables each channel to represent the content in its own individual way. \n\nThe demand for a headless CMS among business owners is constantly growing. The reason for this is the benefits it can bring to your business. Among the main advantages of headless CMS over a traditional one are:\n\n* Flexibility: Delivery channels that ultimately use content from the CMS build the layout and presentation layers in their own individual way using their favorite tools and frameworks. As a result, it creates a unique user experience. \n* Focus on content: A headless CMS comes with a well-defined API, thus, allocating more time for content creation and storage rather than managing and presenting it.\n* Compatibility: It gives the ability to distribute content across various platforms and devices from a single backend.\n* Security: As the Content publishing environment isn’t accessible from the database, using this will prevent malware attacks.\n* Scalability: front-end and backend are detached, so there is no additional time needed for maintenance. You can make customized digital assets and upgrade them without affecting the performance of the entire system.\n* Control: Developers can integrate with any codebase and use any preferred language of their choice.\n \nToday, we see a growing interest from businesses toward headless CMS aided by new software architecture trends, enhanced AI capabilities to deliver personalized content, headless commerce tools that create new choices and customization options for users. However, not all companies can pin down a reliable solution that’s equipped to fuel their unique and specific digital presence for the foreseeable future due to the large CMS market supply. \n\nTo help you, we have identified several types of headless CMS for different business requirements and compiled a list of the most popular headless CMS. So you can learn more about the alternatives, compare features, and narrow down your search based on the pros and cons of each platform to choose the best headless CMS for your company. \n\n##Types of headless CMS. SaaS (cloud-hosted) and On-premise (self-hosted) solutions.\n\nIf we were to split Headless CMS into two categories, we have SaaS and on-premise CMS based on the type of hosting. \n\n###What is an on-premise CMS?\n\nOn-premise solutions are software that is installed and run on individuals computers or the organization using the software. You download it, install on your choice of server and complete the initial setup. With this comes the individual responsibility for the website infrastructure and its software dependencies like databases, necessary software libraries, and more. On-premise CMS can be run locally on your own computer for free, or, if you want to be able to access it from outside of this environment, you can install it on a server with a hosting service for a small monthly fee. \n \n###What are the benefits of investing in an on-premise CMS?\n\nThere are several reasons why using on-premise CMS is better than going with cloud-hosted solutions. They include the following:\n\n* You have full control over data. It makes your business GDPR-compliant.\n* You host the website. Thus, you are in complete control of the website customization and have more freedom in its management.   \n* It can efficiently work without any updates and plugins, if you don’t want to install them.\n* Ability to extend the backend API services and the Admin Panel GUI with your own custom features.\n\n###What is a SaaS CMS?\n \nSimply put, a SaaS CMS is software that exists entirely in a cloud environment. In this case, the solution is provided as a service, reducing the need to support the website infrastructure by software infrastructure and IT teams as it happens with an on-premise CMS. \n \nThe "service" part of SaaS CMS means that the vendor will handle all the questions with upgrading, maintaining, or hosting the website or apps. It allows you to focus on more pressing issues. It can become a problem for companies that deal with sensitive data regularly and don\'t want to transfer the security of their data to a third-party company. At the same time, maintaining high levels of security compliance across your own website does take a lot of work, so eventually it might be easier for businesses to find a trustworthy vendor with a strong history of client satisfaction to take care of their platform. \n\n###Why use a SaaS CMS?\n\nWhile the type of hosting is the primary difference between SaaS and on-premise CMS, it only scratches the surface of SaaS benefits. Some of the resulting benefits of SaaS CMS are:\n\n* Seamless upgrades and enhancements: You get the most up-to-date version of the software without needing to re-implement your solution because all releases and updates are the responsibility of your vendor.\n* Speed to innovation: This CMS offers content admins increased speed to market and reduced friction. Moreover, it makes the adoption to new market trends much easier as the entire change process is streamlined. \n* Simplified maintenance and management: When you move to a SaaS CMS, your vendor typically takes care of maintaining the system and ensuring it’s secure and scalable.\n* Increased time to value: Efficient and simple installation gets your experiences live faster. \n\nEach kind of headless CMS can be considered for different business purposes and project requirements. When you decide on the type of hosting, you will face the question of choosing a platform with headless functionality. Further, we will explore some of the best available SaaS and on-premise headless CMS options. We will pay attention to the features offered by each option and the main differences between them.\n\n##Top Headless CMS 2021 Comparison\n\n###NetlifyCMS\n\n**SaaS or on-premise?** On-premise.\n\n[NetlifyCMS] (https://www.netlifycms.org/)  is one of the most popular Git-based platform in the headless CMS ecosystem.
